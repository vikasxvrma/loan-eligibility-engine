 # 📊 Loan Eligibility Engine

A cloud-native serverless platform that ingests user financial data, discovers loan products, and matches eligible users with suitable financial offers.

The system is built using AWS serverless infrastructure and demonstrates event-driven architecture, asynchronous pipelines, and scalable cloud services.

## 🚀 System Overview

The platform automates the process of:

* Ingesting user financial data via CSV uploads

* Discovering loan products from external sources

* Matching users with eligible financial products

* Notifying users via email

This architecture separates data ingestion, product discovery, and user notification into independent pipelines.

## 🏗 Architecture
### User Ingestion Pipeline
```
Frontend (S3 Static Website)
        ↓
API Gateway
        ↓
Generate Upload URL (Lambda)
        ↓
S3 Upload Bucket
        ↓
Process CSV (Lambda)
        ↓
PostgreSQL (RDS)
        ↓
Match Users With Products
        ↓
Notify Users
        ↓
SES Email
```
This pipeline enables secure bulk ingestion of user data through presigned upload URLs.
### Loan Discovery Pipeline
```
CloudWatch Scheduler
        ↓
discoverLoans (Python)
        ↓
persistDiscoveredProducts
        ↓
loan_products table
```

## 🧠 Design Principles

- **Serverless-first architecture** for scalability and reduced operational overhead
- **Event-driven processing** for asynchronous data ingestion
- **Decoupled pipelines** to isolate ingestion and product discovery workflows
- **Cloud-native services** to simplify infrastructure management
  
## ⚙️ Key Features
* Secure CSV uploads via presigned S3 URLs

* Serverless event-driven pipeline

* Automated loan discovery

* User-product eligibility matching

* Automated email notifications

* Fully cloud-native architecture

## ▶️ Deployment
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Deploy infrastructure using:
```
serverless deploy
```

### 📬 Example Workflow
- User uploads a CSV containing financial data

- System processes and stores users

- Loan products are discovered via scheduled jobs

- Matching engine finds eligible products

- Eligible users receive email notifications

### 🔮 Future Improvements
* Real-time eligibility scoring

* Credit risk model integration

* Dashboard for loan analytics

* Queue-based processing using SQS
